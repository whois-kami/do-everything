Do-Everything App
Description
This customized Do-Everything app, built with Flutter, utilizes the BLoC pattern for state management and Drift as a local database. It is designed to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions, offering a straightforward yet effective tool for comprehensive task management.

❗ Project Objective
In the process of this project, I worked with the BLoC pattern as a state manager and transitioned to a relational SQL database using Drift. I designed the app myself, incorporating learning from themes and MediaQuery to ensure maintainability and ease of data modification. The architecture, although not strictly clean, is modular and resilient, minimizing the risk of breaking functionality with isolated changes.

⚡️ Technologies Involved
Dart: The programming language used.
Flutter: The comprehensive UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications.
BLoC (Business Logic Component): For state management, providing a predictable state management solution.
Drift: A reactive persistence library for local storage solutions.
Asynchronous Programming: To handle operations efficiently.
Architecture: Not strictly clean, but functional and aesthetically pleasing.
